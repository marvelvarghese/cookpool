## Departures from the design

### SM1 — the database near its people (SM-3)

- **A new database beside the old one, not a replacement.** Design §1.2
  item 3 says the database is "recreated" with the hint `apac`. It is a new
  database, `cookpool-<env>-apac` (resource
  `cloudflare_d1_database.platform_apac`), and the one before it
  (`cookpool-<env>`, no hint) is dropped from Terraform's state with a
  `removed { lifecycle { destroy = false } }` block instead of being
  destroyed. A replacement in place would have deleted the old database at
  the start of the run, leaving every Worker bound to a database that no
  longer exists until its own deploy, or for longer if a deploy failed.
  This way each Worker keeps serving from the old database until it is
  redeployed onto the new one. D1 names are unique per account, hence the
  suffix; every Worker's `wrangler.template.jsonc` names the new database.
  **Owner step:** once the run is green and the old databases' Metrics show
  no queries since it, delete `cookpool-stage` and `cookpool-prod` in the
  Cloudflare dashboard.
- **The Cloudflare provider of `cloudflare-d1` moves to v5, pinned to
  5.28.1.** v4 (`~> 4.30`, at most 4.52.10) has no location hint on
  `cloudflare_d1_database`. 5.28.1 has `primary_location_hint` and upgrades
  the v4 state of this resource on its own. The provider gets an exact pin
  because the root has no lock file. `cloudflare-kv` and `cloudflare-domain`
  stay on v4. Creating the database through the D1 API inside `adopt.tf` was
  the alternative. It was rejected because that step runs at plan time, so a
  pull request's plan-only lane would have created the database before the
  merge.
- **The hint counts only at creation** (`ignore_changes =
  [primary_location_hint]`). Cloudflare never returns the hint, so an
  adopted (imported) database would otherwise plan a replacement, which
  deletes its rows.
- **Every Worker bound to `PLATFORM_DB` now waits on `db-migrate` on main**
  (an enforced edge, advisory on pull requests). Before, only identity,
  kitchen and notifications did, and the other ten would have gone live on
  the new, empty database before its tables existed. api-edge reads no
  tables (its `/health` ping only) but takes the edge too, so the rule has no
  exception. notifications-worker's edge, already ordering on main, now says
  so explicitly. tests/config-worker pins the edges.
- **Smart Placement is declared at the top level** of the thirteen
  templates, so `dev` inherits it as well. dev is verify-only (dry runs), so
  this changes nothing deployed. Placement moves fetch handlers only: cron
  triggers (kitchen, metering, integrations, webhooks) and api-edge's
  `RateLimiterDO` are placed as before. policy-worker and web-console-next
  bind no database and are unchanged.
- **Not measured yet:** whether reads from India now stay under 0.4 s. That
  is SM-2's timing check. Smart Placement moves a Worker only after it sees
  steady traffic from several locations, so a quiet environment may keep
  running near the caller for a while.
