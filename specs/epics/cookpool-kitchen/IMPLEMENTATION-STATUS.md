## Departures from the design

### CP0 — work is minted in Orunbase, not declared by a file
The design (and the factory skill at the time) declared the epic in
`epic.yaml` with a `work:` section in `intent.yaml`. orun 2.82 removed both:
the epic `cookpool-kitchen` (EP-2), its seven milestones and every task are
created in Orunbase with `orun task …`, the doc set lives in
`specs/epics/cookpool-kitchen/`, and contracts in `tasks/`. Contract `affects`
names components as `default/cookpool/<component>`.

### CP1 — open groups instead of plan changes (CP-2)
The design said "raise `limit.organizations` and turn on `multi_org`". The
baseline's MO2 gate would still have made a person's *earliest* group — maybe
someone else's — the billing parent of every group they create. Built instead:
`OPEN_GROUPS` in membership-worker (each group standalone, at most 50 per
person, `412 groups_per_person`); only `limit.members` was raised (5 → 50).

### CP1 — join links without an approval queue (CP-3)
Routes as built: `GET/POST …/join-code[/rotate]` (owner/admin),
`GET /v1/join/:code`, `POST /v1/join`, `POST /v1/organizations/:org/leave`.
A link joins straight away as `builder`; no approval option in v1.

### CP1 — settings are defaults until first saved (CP-4)
"A group created with its settings" became: GET returns INR / split equally
until the first PATCH; the currency locks once a row exists.

### CP1 — billing not hidden in the admin console (CP-2 → CP-5)
Instead of hiding billing, the console now opens as Cookpool at `/home`
(CP-5); the admin console stays reachable from the account menu.

### CP1 — gaps in the app shell (CP-5), carried into CP-9
- Other members show as short `usr_…` ids: `PublicMember` has no name.
- The Groups list shows no role or member count (the list API returns
  neither), and members (non-admins) don't see a member count.
- The last owner is told to hand over ownership, but no screen changes
  roles yet.
